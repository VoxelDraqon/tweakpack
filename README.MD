This is just a pack I made for myself with some small adjustments. These are the kinds of adjustments that might be found in something like [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/).
### The pack _is_ the `tweakpack` folder, not the entire repository. It's easiest to just download from [Releases](https://github.com/VoxelDraqon/tweakpack/releases).
## Changes:
* quieter dirt/gravel sounds
* changes crying part of crying obsidian to the original beta texture
* adjusts quartz bricks to look like other bricks (stone, deepslate, etc.)
* replaces gray part on top of cow leg with brown
